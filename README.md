# Re:Survive

**Re:Survive** is an action-packed rogue-like bullet hell game where you must defeat everything that appears on your screen.

The game is heavily inspired by popular series such as **Re:Zero**, **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**, and **Vampire Survivors**.

### Assets:
All in-game assets are pre-made, with the following exceptions:

- **Music**: Composed by Ori, a friend of mine.
- **Sound Effects**: All sound effects are created by me, with the exception of the lightning, witch's clock, and guardian angel sounds.
- **Graphics**: Both the menu and in-game backgrounds are created using shaders. In fact, almost every visual effect you see in the game is achieved through shadersâ€”because shaders are awesome!
